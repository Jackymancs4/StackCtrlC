# StackOverflowCtrlC
A copy button for Stack Overflow markup &lt;pre>s. Made entirely in JavaScript and JQuery.

## Features
- A copy button made entirely with JavaScript and JQuery. 
- It follows the css from `.post-tag` class (so you don't need to worry about Stylish).
- It makes my live easier, so I guess it will make yours too. 

## See for yourself
#### Default layout (without stylish)

## Why?
###### Because:
- After all this time, and even though there exists this piece of meta: [Meta](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/32625/shortcut-or-button-for-copying-posted-code-from-stack-overflow), [and even more Meta](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251883/select-all-copy-all-button-for-code), SO devs still did nothing with this. 
- It's been 7 (SEVEN) years. For Christ's sake.
- Every single plugin I found on this topic was made with a total disregard for Stylish plugin. And it hurts my eyes.

## Install process
I'm working on it.

## Notes
**It probably won't work with Safari**. Simply put, at the time of writing this, Safari doesn't support `document.execCommand('copy')`, or some similar shenanigans are involved, and I don't support Safari. Code appreciated [tho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbacoPpUSA).
