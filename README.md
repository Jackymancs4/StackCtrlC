# StackOverflowCtrlC
Copy button for Stack Overflow markup &lt;pre>s. Made entirely in JavaScript and JQuery.

## Why?
- Because after all that time, and even though there exists this piece of meta: [Meta](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/32625/shortcut-or-button-for-copying-posted-code-from-stack-overflow), [And even more Meta](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251883/select-all-copy-all-button-for-code), SO devs still did nothing with this. 
- It's been 7 (SEVEN) years. For Christ's sake.
- Every single plugin I found on this topic was made with a total disregard for Stylish plugin. And it hurts my eyes.
- [Not invented here syndrome.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here)

## Install process
In progress to make it simple.

## Notes
**It probably won't work with Safari**. Simply put, at the time of writing this, Safari doesn't support `document.execCommand('copy')`, or some similar shenanigans are involved, and I don't support Safari. Code appreciated [tho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zbacoPpUSA).
